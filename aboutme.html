                <h1>Sports (Recreational & Competitive)</h1>
                <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy staying active. I play a variety of sports recreationally such as; badminton,
                    volleyball, ultimate frisbee, and swimming (just to name a few). I will honestly try and play any sport (atleast once)! My "main sport" however, is Figure Skating. I've been a competitive figure skater for 10+ years starting back in 2010. Before entering University I competed under the <a href="https://www.sfsc.on.ca/">Scarboro Figure Skating Club</a>. During my time there I won the Provincial title in the Senior Bronze Mens event at the 2016 Skate Ontario Championships in Sudbury, ON. Since entering university at UWaterloo in 2018, I have been a student-athlete throughout all 5 years of my undergraduate degree part of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wloofigureskating/?hl=en">Warriors Varsity Figure Skating</a> team. Our 2022/2023 season was our best season since joining the team. At the 2023 Ontario University Association (OUA) Championships I was part of the <a href="https://athletics.uwaterloo.ca/news/2023/3/9/brown-wins-three-medals-warriors-finish-seventh-at-oua-figure-skating-championship.aspx">bronze medal winning</a> skate in the Dance Fours event! I intend on continuing my skating career with UWaterloo during my masters degree.

                <h1>Video Games</h1>
                <p>Video games is usually something I turn to when I wanna give my brain a rest and do something a bit more relaxed. You'll usually find me playing with friends on MMO-games. I am always open to new game suggestions!</p>

                <h1>Hiking</h1>
                <p>Thanks to my parents getting really into hiking and camping during the summer I am now also now hooked on hiking/camping. Being out in nature (especially near water!) is very calming and makes for some great photography oppurtunites. Check out some of the picture I've taken on these trips below! </p>
